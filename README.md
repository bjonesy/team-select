This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.5.

## Description

A mock server list of items which is a list of 32 NFL Football teams in alphabetical order.  Each time a user selects a list item it adds a select state to the item.  When a selected a close icon will appear on the list item which allows a user to delete the item from the page.
